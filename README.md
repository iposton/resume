# Resume - <a href="http://www.getmdl.io/">Material Design Lite</a>
This is a basic single page resume using the material design lite library. It is responsive and looks good on small screens. Feel free to use as you wish replace my personal content with your own, move things around, change the colors, and have fun! 

I used the fixed tab layout which is a powerful template that lets you set multiple tabs that change the content of the page without loading a new page. 

I was able to host this resume with my free github account using gh-pages follow these simple steps to get your online resume live in less than 60 seconds.
